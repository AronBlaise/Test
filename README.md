The Unity Scene will have 10 objects (5 movable and 5 immovable), have the movable objects in a different color. Pick whatever you want.

- The Camera should be a Third Person Camera and will follow the Player(one of the movable objects), controlled via the WASD keys.
- When the player controlled object collides with a movable object, the controls and camera are both switched to the object the player collides with.
- Only the player will be controlled by the keyboard at all times.
